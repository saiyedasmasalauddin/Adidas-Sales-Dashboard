# Adidas-Sales-Dashboard
- In this project, I utilized Tableau to create a comprehensive set of visualizations that leverage a wide array of chart types to analyze and present data effectively.
- I explored various types of charts, including  bar charts, line charts,filled map,Symbol map, Stacked column chart,Scatter plot, Highlight table, text table ,heat map and tree map.
- To further enhance the analytical depth, I created interactive dashboards that combine multiple visualizations, allowing for dynamic data exploration and real-time insights. Additionally, I developed stories within Tableau to narrate a cohesive and compelling narrative, guiding the audience through key findings and strategic recommendations.
